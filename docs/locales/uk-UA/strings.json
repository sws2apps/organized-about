    "tr_shouldUseA": "<p>It’s not a must – you can use the app separately (for example, as a coordinator, public talks coordinator, secretary, territory overseer, etc.), but the more people in your congregation use the app, the easier it is to collaborate.</p><p>Using Organized makes it convenient for publishers, as all appointed brothers can easily create and publish schedules, assignments, and events directly within the app, and everyone in congregation can easily find and view it.</p>",
    "tr_manuallyEnterQ": "Do I have to manually enter info from the meeting workbook?",
    "tr_manuallyEnterA": "No, you don't have to. Organized can automatically fetch all meeting parts, public talks, and other needed information directly from jw.org or .epub file.

    "tr_pwaMeaningQ": "Organized is a PWA. What does that mean?",
    "tr_pwaMeaningA": "A Progressive Web App (PWA) is a type of website that works like a native app but runs in your web browser.

You can either use it on any device with a web browser, just like a regular website, or click “Install” button to add the app to your home page and get better experience.",
    "tr_securityQ": "Is Organized secured and protected to be used in a congregation?",
    "tr_securityA": "<p>Sure! We take security seriously. You can use the app locally with just your device, but for the full experience, try features that sync online across your devices and other within your congregation. This way, everyone in the congregation using Organized can see schedules, assignments, territories, and more that you share.</p><p>Even though these features requires Internet connection to sync, all the data is securely protected. Once brother creates a congregation, he creates a strong encryption key for the congregation. Therefore, the congregation data is secure, as long as he keeps the encryption code in a safe place.</p><p>Rest assured, your congregation data is fully secure. Without the key, <b>no one can access it – neither the Organized app team nor anyone on the internet.</b></p><p>With the next updates, you will be able to run Organized on your own server with your own database, giving you uncompromized control over all data and access.</p>",
    "tr_whoCanUseQ": "Who in congregation can use Organized?",
    "tr_whoCanUseA": "The app is a tool for everyone in your congregation – from elders and ministerial servants to pioneers, publishers and even midweek meeting students.

    "tr_isOfficialQ": "Is Organized an official app of Jehovah’s Witnesses?",
    "tr_isOfficialA": "<p>No, the app is not made by Jehovah’s Witnesses organization.

Most of our team members are pioneers, ministerial servants and elders.</p><p>Additionally, we recommend that the usage of the Organized app be approved by the congregation body of elders.</p>",
