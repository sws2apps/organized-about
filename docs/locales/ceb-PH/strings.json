    "tr_shouldUseQ": "Should the whole congregation use Organized?",
    "tr_shouldUseA": "<p>This is possible, but not mandatory - you can use the app alone (for example, as a congregation coordinator, public talk coordinator, secretary, territory overseer, etc.), but the more people use the app, the easier it is to collaborate.</p><p>Using Organized makes it much easier and more convenient for publishers and appointed brothers to create and publish schedules, assignments, and events directly in the app, and everyone in the congregation can easily find and view all of this.</p>",
    "tr_manuallyEnterQ": "Do I have to manually enter info from the meeting workbook?",
    "tr_manuallyEnterA": "No, you don't have to. Organized can automatically fetch all meeting parts, public talks, and other needed information directly from jw.org or .epub file.

    "tr_autoAssignQ": "Does the app have automatic assign feature?",

Additionally, the app already supports many other languages like Polish, Ukrainian, Malagasy, Russian, Romanian, and more.</p><p>If you want to translate the app into your language, it's easy – see our <a href='#'>translation guide</a>.</p>",

You can either use it on any device with a modern web browser, just like a regular website, or click “Install” button to add the app to your home page and get better experience.",
    "tr_securityQ": "Is Organized secure and protected to be used in a congregation?",
    "tr_securityA": "<p>Sure! We take security seriously. You can use the app locally with just your device, but for the full experience, try features that use online sync across your devices and other within your congregation. This way, everyone in the congregation using Organized can see schedules, assignments, territories, and more that you share.</p><p>Even though these features requires Internet connection to sync, all the data is securely protected. Once brother creates a congregation, he creates a strong encryption key for the congregation. Therefore, the congregation data is secure, as long as he keeps the encryption code in a safe place.</p><p>Rest assured, your congregation data is fully secure. Without the key, <b>no one can access it – neither the Organized app team nor anyone on the internet.</b></p><p>With the next updates, you will be able to run Organized on your own server with your own database, giving you uncompromized control over all data and access.</p>",

Most of our team members are pioneers, ministerial servants and elders.</p><p>Additionally, we recommend that the usage of the Organized app be approved by the congregation body of elders.</p>",
